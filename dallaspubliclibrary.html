<p> The purpose of this report is to help identify possible website digital accessibility issues in order to prevent any access issues to this website via assistive technologies. The following accessibility checklist is based on the 
<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/preliminary/"> W3C WAI Easy Checks- A First Review of Web Accessibility</a>
</p>

<h2> Website Title Page</h2>
<p> Results: The page title is found in the window title bar in the browser dispaying "Dallas Public Library" even when there are multiple web pages open. The title "Dallas Public Library" is also shown in search engine results. When I favorited and bookmarked the web page, "Dallas Public Library" was also the title that appeared and read by screen readers. However, the title for all pages on the website is "Dallas Public Library" rather than an accurate description of the page that it is on to distinguish the page from other webpages such as "catalog" or "my account." </p>

<h2> Image Text Alternatives</h2>
<p> Results: There are 18 images missing alternative text, and 7 images that do contain alternative text. This means that people using assistive technologies would not know what the photo or graphic is communicating. I recommend that all photos and graphics have descriptive alt text to allow the site to be accessible to all users.</p>

<h2> Text:</h2>
<p> Results Headings: There were no headings found on the pages, no text is bigger than the other which means there is no meaningful hierarchy to the webpage. </p>
<p> Results Contrast Ratio: After grayscale, eye-dropper, and the WAVE analysis, there are 15 very low contrast errors that make it difficult for some viewers to be able to read through the page with ease. .</p>
<p> Results Resizing Text: When zoomin in, the Dallas Public Library website scales up text size using keyboard commands very well. Text was increased up to 500% and readability remained comprehensible on a desktop and iPhone.

</p>

<h2> Interaction:</h2>
<p> Results: Keyboard focus was visible and followed a logical order through the page elements. Visible keyboard focus bordered items that when selected, moved as I tabbed through the web page.</p>
<p> Results Forms, Labels and Errors: I tested the "My Account" page because it had a form to fill out. Using only the keyboard, I was able to go to each form field and press submit successfully without using the mouse.
</p>

<h2> General:</h2>
<p> Moving, Flashing, or Blinking Content Results: I was not able to locate any moving, blinking, or scrolling information that started automatically or lasted more than five seconds.There was no moving information or content that was bright or flashing either. </p>
<p> Multimeldia (video,audio) Results: The kids summer page had a Youtube linked video with closed captions and downloadable transcripts. .</p>
<p> Basic Structure Check Results: I used WAVE to remove all CSS styles in order to see the DPL website without any visual styling. There were 15 total very low contrast errors and it looks like there are many heavy graphics that limit the potenial space on the page to organize the information more efficently.</p>

<h2> In Summary</h2>
<p> Thank you for taking the time to review my findings! I have confidence that the issues mentioned can be easily resolved to improve overall accessibility for the site.</p>
